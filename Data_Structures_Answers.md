Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method? O(n), as it visits every node in the tree once.

2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function? constant? nothing is being created or stored.

3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n^2), thanks to nested for loops.

6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`? O(n)? the names in the files aren't copied over or stored anywhere, but the list containing the duplicates would be expected to grow.

7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n) with one for loop

8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`? O(n)
